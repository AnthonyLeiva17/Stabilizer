// This video stablisation smooths the global trajectory using a sliding average window

const int HORIZONTAL_BORDER_CROP = 50; // In pixels. Crops the border to reduce the black borders from stabilisation being too noticeable.

// 1. Get previous to current frame transformation (dx, dy, da) for all frames
// 2. Accumulate the transformations to get the image trajectory
// 3. Smooth out the trajectory using an averaging window
// 4. Generate new set of previous to current transform, such that the trajectory ends up being the same as the smoothed trajectory
// 5. Apply the new transformation to the video
